# Resume Parser 1.0

## Project Overview:
The Resume Parser 1.0 is an innovative Python project that harnesses the power of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning to categorize resumes into specific job types, significantly streamlining HR processes. This project offers a robust solution for automating the classification of resumes, effectively identifying critical content such as skills and experiences, ultimately enhancing the efficiency of candidate screening.

## Key Features:

### 1. Resume Content Extraction:
- Utilizes advanced NLP techniques  accurately extract relevant information from resumes.
- Employs Stemming and Lemmatization for advanced text-preprocessing and TF-IDF for vectorization.

### 2. Model-Based Classification:
- Employs a Gradient Boosting model for precise classification of resumes into predefined job categories.
- Enhances the accuracy and consistency of the categorization process.

### 3. User-Friendly Web Interface:
- Hosts a user-friendly web interface developed with Streamlit for easy access to the model.
- Allows users to conveniently upload resumes in '.pdf' and '.txt' formats.

## How It Works:
Users can upload resumes through the web interface, as demonstrated in the sample screenshot above. The project's machine learning model then processes the uploaded resume, extracting relevant information and categorizing it into specific job types. This streamlined approach enhances HR efficiency, making the candidate screening process faster and more accurate.

## Example Result:
For instance, consider the sample resume shown below:

## What I Learned

During the development of the Resume Parser 1.0 project, I gained valuable knowledge and skills:

1. **Advanced Text Preprocessing Techniques**: I acquired expertise in advanced text preprocessing methods, enabling me to effectively clean and extract pertinent information from unstructured text data. This encompassed handling diverse resume formats and organizing textual content efficiently.

2. **Application of Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: I applied NLP techniques to comprehend and interpret the content within resumes. This involved extracting critical insights, such as skills, experiences, and qualifications, which are pivotal for precise resume classification.

3. **Local Website Hosting**: I successfully designed and hosted a locally created website using Streamlit. This experience empowered me to create an accessible user interface for uploading resumes and engaging with the machine learning model.

These newly acquired skills have not only contributed to the development of this project but have also broadened my expertise in the realms of NLP, machine learning, and web development. I eagerly anticipate further refining these skills and exploring new opportunities in the dynamic fields of technology and data science.
