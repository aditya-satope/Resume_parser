# Resume Parser 1.0

## Project Overview:
The Resume Parser 1.0 is an innovative Python project that harnesses the power of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning to categorize resumes into specific job types, significantly streamlining HR processes. This project offers a robust solution for automating the classification of resumes, effectively identifying critical content such as skills and experiences, ultimately enhancing the efficiency of candidate screening.

## Key Features:

### 1. Resume Content Extraction:
- Utilizes advanced NLP techniques to accurately extract relevant information from resumes.
- Recognizes and categorizes key sections, including skills, experiences, and qualifications.

### 2. Model-Based Classification:
- Employs machine learning models for precise classification of resumes into predefined job categories.
- Enhances the accuracy and consistency of the categorization process.

### 3. User-Friendly Web Interface:
- Hosts a user-friendly web interface developed with Streamlit for easy access to the model.
- Allows users to conveniently upload resumes in '.pdf' and '.txt' formats.

## How It Works:
Users can upload resumes through the web interface, as demonstrated in the sample screenshot above. The project's machine learning model then processes the uploaded resume, extracting relevant information and categorizing it into specific job types. This streamlined approach enhances HR efficiency, making the candidate screening process faster and more accurate.

## Example Result:
For instance, consider the sample resume shown below:
